geometry/morton.hpp
  Ensure that mortonSort works in 3D for: 
    (uint32_t, float)
    (uint32_t, double)
    (uint64_t, double)

Quadrilateral.contains
  On a GPU, is it more performant to short circuit the areCCW or to compute them all? 

Quadrilateral.area
  For a quadrilateral with 3 collinear points, is the area still correct?

Quadrilateral.centroid
  For a quadrilateral with 3 collinear points, is the centroid still correct?

QuadraticSegment.isLeft
  Benchmark the old and new implementations.

RegularGrid.getBoxIDContaining(point)

TriMesh.regularPartition
  3 by 3 grid. 
    6  7  8
    3  4  5
    0  1  2
    The cells on the diagonal (0, 4, 8) should contain 0 and 1. 
    Cell 6 = 1
    Cell 2 = 0
    Cells 1, 3, 5, 7 are indeterminate due to floating point error.
