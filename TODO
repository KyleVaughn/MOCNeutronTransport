get back to full functionality first.
Then do the vis.
Then do chores below

Make Spatial partition templated again.


NOLINT
diagnostic push
suppress

modular ray tests

Make a function to init string from pointer and size for small and big string
this will avoid repeated code.

Move to_vecvec to API or gmsh

Pointer arithmetic for face vertex mesh intersect
Don't make the face or call getEdge. Just make the edge in the same memory location?

Review for tests, parallelism, performance, comments, and structure, replace std::string and std::vector 
  finished:
    stdlib
    common
    math
    geometry
