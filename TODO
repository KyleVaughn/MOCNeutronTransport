Check mesh is morton order
  ismortonorder(mesh) -> issorted( by = x -> encode_morton)

Morton order difference:
  Sort rvec
  morton point in face

Get timing info for packets.

Figure out how to deal with material IDS

Find face with morton order

Setup morton ordering with elsets

Ray cast timing:
  intersect + find face vs pure ray casting.

Ray packet intersection functions:
  Use a matrix instead of vec of vecs.
  If any(r != r_miss), vec(N * i + j) = (...) tuple

Structured grid acceleration structure.
Edge to edge RT using structured grid.
  Intersect each face in the grid. Meaning use the connectivity info of the AABB, which is more
  reliable. Go in columns or rows based upon the largest \Deltax?
