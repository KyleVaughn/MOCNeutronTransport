intersect volume mesh edges
intersect volume mesh faces
intersect polytope mesh edges
intersect polytope mesh faces
intersect mesh partition tree edges
intersect mesh partition tree faces
back to C program to intersect a line segment with a mesh
test difference in line intersecting mesh using jl_function vs using cfunctioni + jl_function
back to Fortran to intersect a line segment with a mesh

point in face for polytope
find face
    May wish to consider an acceleration structure here
        RECTILINEAR GRID
        USE BOUNDING BOX OF THE POLYGONS TO MAKE THE TREE
        This algorithm to do the splitting should be similar to the CMFD grid algorithm
        computing a split plane in a spatial partitioning hierarchy
        We can be smart and cache some values for the next point
