Mesh-> Reorder

Make rep meshes. 
  Test point containment, ray intersection, etc

Mesh-> Faster find face

If overlay grid fails, check the refactor comments in model.inl

TriMesh.faceContaining, Find the closest point first, then just test all faces around it 
  Benchmark this

Faster to use the edge method or write the loop explicitly?

mesh statistics

Examine Ray/LineSegment, Ray/Mesh, Ray/QuadraticSegement intersections by
using a change of basis to make the ray R = o + t*d into R = o' + t'*d' where
d' = (1, 0, 0) and o' = (0, 0, 0).  Then the intersection is just the

Regular Partiton of mesh, but set the cells based upon membership on lower left point of AABB
  Less memory.
  Also set grid equal to largest object size or bigger. Therefore, no object canbe in more than 2 cells in 1 direction
