Add debug build that uses sanitiziation

Setup continuous integration for:
  debug and release
  gcc and clang
  CUDA enabled/disabled
  For each of the above, run:
    clang-tidy
    cppcheck
    clang-format
    tests

Find an appropriate set of warnings for:
  clang
  gcc
  nvcc 

Setup Sphinx/Read the Docs

Add code coverage

Add OpenGL or other visualization for user interface for mesh viewing
  Maybe just call Gmsh? Would need to account for Gmsh being active in the current process.
