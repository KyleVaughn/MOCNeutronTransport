Follow Eigen documentation and setup multithreading and CUDA tests

Can vector be replaced with Eigen?
Vector int, uint, float, double, uint64,int64
Vector noexcept

vec2 int, uint etc. noexcept


Setup Sphinx/Read the Docs

Add code coverage

Add OpenGL or other visualization for user interface for mesh viewing
  Maybe just call Gmsh? Would need to account for Gmsh being active in the current process.

Half edge mesh
CrossSection struct
Reading/Writing MPACT files
