Need to generate images before modular rays
Need to generate rays before benchmark
Benchmark intersection
Benchmark intersection for pointer arithmetic version
Benchmark using insertion sort
Benchmark with morton ordered mesh

To clarify:
  morton and not morton ordered
  sort using std::sort and insertion sort
  binned and not binned

Make the C API functions for the spatial partition into member functions of the partition
Benchmark for MPACT model of VERA 2A -> find face and RT

Fix binned mesh
Work on intersection benchmark and mesh + MPACT stats

GPU version of intersection
  Just transfer the mesh to the GPU and do operations there

mesh reorder

mesh getUniqueEdges

apply permutation test

nolints/cppchecks make sure all are justified
Check pragma diagnostic push/pop
