rect mesh partition type
intersect rect mesh edges
intersect rect mesh faces
test difference in line intersecting mesh using jl_function vs using cfunction
find face
    May wish to consider an acceleration structure here
        RECTILINEAR GRID
        USE BOUNDING BOX OF THE POLYGONS TO MAKE THE TREE
        This algorithm to do the splitting should be similar to the CMFD grid algorithm
        computing a split plane in a spatial partitioning hierarchy
        We can be smart and cache some values for the next point
multithreading for materialize edges & faces, submesh.
edge to edge RT

OTF ray trace for effective optical thickness calculation.
Ensure functions are not allocating using @allocated

Do explicit typing where possible.
