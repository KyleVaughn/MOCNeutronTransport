Add tbb to cmake options and spack
libtbb-dev

Requires for the member functions of dions and polygons

Check on implicit vs explicit converions in constructions

points -> epsilon, infinity, etc.
 
Add tests for the parallel functions

intersection test for mesh: quad, tri6, quad8
Need to generate images before modular rays
Need to generate rays before benchmark
Benchmark intersection
Benchmark intersection for pointer arithmetic version
Benchmark using insertion sort
Benchmark with morton ordered mesh

To clarify:
  morton and not morton ordered
  sort using std::sort and insertion sort
  binned and not binned

Make the C API functions for the spatial partition into member functions of the partition
Benchmark for MPACT model of VERA 2A -> find face and RT

Write up instructions for VERA 2A

Check on status of all code
  Fix binned mesh
Work on intersection benchmark and mesh + MPACT stats

identify functions for parallelization

GPU version of intersection
  Just transfer the mesh to the GPU and do operations there

mesh reorder

mesh getUniqueEdges

Meaure using std::sort for intersections vs insertion sort
  Benchmark this
  Benchmark also for binned mesh where this will be abigger issue

  apply permutation test

move code that can be parallelized to a different directory

nolints/cppchecks make sure all are justified
Check pragma diagnostic push/pop
