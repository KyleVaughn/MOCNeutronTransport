openmp and cuda kernels for bounding box and the mesh functions

Add OpenMP to the test matrix

Create benchmark of bounding box of a vector of 2D oints
  Add bench to CMake Dir

DO the set_child function but as a member function for the mesh

Benchmark methods for CPU and GPU
  Larger meshes -> pin cell, lattice, and full core
  Need IO to read these
  Use these to determine for what N we should use single thread, multi-thread, or GPU

Examine Ray/LineSegment, Ray/Mesh, Ray/QuadraticSegement intersections by
using a change of basis to make the ray R = o + t*d into R = o' + t'*d' where
d' = (1, 0, 0) and o' = (0, 0, 0).  Then the intersection is just the

Remove thrust as a dependency? 

Seach for NOLINTS and check that they are still needed

Line in opengl
Reading/Writing MPACT files

CrossSection struct

Vis:
 Render a line segment
 Add GUI and options for edge and vertex selection and edges/faces on/off
 Use instancing for repeated pins
 Use ray casted picking for selection
