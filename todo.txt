Write image of mesh in RegularPartition. Just color by the cell and print the edges
Test with a larger mesh -> IO

openmp and cuda kernels for mesh functions

Add OpenMP to the test matrix

Use these to determine for what N we should use single thread, multi-thread, or GPU

Examine Ray/LineSegment, Ray/Mesh, Ray/QuadraticSegement intersections by
using a change of basis to make the ray R = o + t*d into R = o' + t'*d' where
d' = (1, 0, 0) and o' = (0, 0, 0).  Then the intersection is just the
