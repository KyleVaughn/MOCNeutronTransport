Quadratic Geom
Rectilinear Grid

Examine Ray/LineSegment, Ray/Mesh, Ray/QuadraticSegement intersections by
using a change of basis to make the ray R = o + t*d into R = o' + t'*d' where
d' = (1, 0, 0) and o' = (0, 0, 0).  Then the intersection is just the

FVM
  vertices xyz
  faces v0 v1 v2
  ff (f1, f2, f3) ??
  vf (v1, v2, v3)
  vf offsets

Consider adding a mesh with edges

String -> MeshFile

Seach for NOLINTS and check that they are still needed

Mat?

Line in opengl
Reading/Writing MPACT files

CrossSection struct

Vis:
 Render a line segment
 Add GUI and options for edge and vertex selection and edges/faces on/off
 Use instancing for repeated pins
 Use ray casted picking for selection
