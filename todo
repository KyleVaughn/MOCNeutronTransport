tau vs approx spectral radius

err norm starts around 1e-2, hence rho = np.exp(np.log(err/1e-2)/Niter)

jarrett paper shows faster convergence than predicted by 1D based upon te group 7 xsec

where are they getting the plot in figure 1?

want to review jarrett paper with Brendan
  -> Seems we have all variables to determine spectral radius 
  -> estimate spectral radius
    -> error reduction between iterations
      -> can bound using linear

getTotalChordLength(Point * begin, Point * end)
  Given a bunch of points that are intersection with the face, handle floating point error
  and return the total chord length
  if convex, there should only be 2 and we can disregard
  if concave, we might have miultiple segments. Determing if the midpoint of the segment is
  within the cell to ensure validity

change start/end/stop to begin/end

add likely/unlikely to emplace/push_back

How should mean chord length be computed for azimuthally extruded mesh?

-> eliminate duplicates
-> Use compare? Must be morton sorted
