Currently working through polygon/geometry

NOLINTS, cppcheck, diagnostic
ADD TRACE statements to routines

Check that no pure functions invoke the logger

to_vecvec with Vector


isApproxConvex
add approximately convex routine for quadrilateral
  -> area
  -> meanchordlength





std::vector insert

old benchmarks to archive

mortonsort for polytope soup
reserve elements/vertices for submesh and read: abaqus, xdmf, FVM.toPolytopesoup, spatial_part.toPolytopeSoup

iterators for edges and faces

ray tests
modular ray tests
cross section tests
material tests

test pointer arithmetic versus index for ray/mesh intersection
test iterating over edges with getEdge vs just manually making them

effect test of morton order on intersect

is_morton_ordered to fvm

binned fvm
