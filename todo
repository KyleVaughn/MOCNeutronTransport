add cuda and valgrind to unit test macto

python API

Benchmarks:
  measure effect of SIMD_VEC
  measure effect of FAST_MATH -> error

for tests, check against max error and output error into some file

use build scripts to bundle CMAKE options

Dirs done with NOLINT/pragma:

constexpr tests up to:
  stdlib

CUDA:
  simplify CUDA unit test macros now that we default to 1 thread. Includes TEST_HOSTDEV(f<T>)

Once I'm done with refactor:
  static_assert to STATIC_ASSERT in tests
