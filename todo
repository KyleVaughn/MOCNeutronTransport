mean chord length does not compute gap right
It must do r0 --- r1  skip... r1 --- r2. But we must deal with the case where
r0 is approx r1. If so, we skip. BUT) this could lead to counting a big gap area on
a jagged edged. Should we say this will happen infrequently?

If r0 and r1 are close, maybe we are on a corner. and correct behavior is do r0,r1.
There should ve an even number of pairs.
could test midpoint inside the polygon for membership

isConvex to polygon
  -> if any edges is not approxCCW, then it's not convex.
  -> Therefore check all edges first
  -> Then, check the linear edges

Make non-trivial convex quadratic shapes for meanChordLength tests
Add a "isConvex" to quadratic shapes so we can avoid the MCL routine

meanChordLength is fucked.
