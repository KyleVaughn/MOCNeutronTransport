Add scattering matrix to Xsec
Don't store redundant info? Total
  Optimize to be lower triangular when build without upscatter?

Move the picture of the model to above the code in the tutorial

Resolve casts in gmsh API

Add overlap check to face vertex mesh validate routine

Narrowing uint32_t cast

Handle Size == I now

Modify the Gmsh functions so that they are templated where necessary

Binned mesh
  Need vis before to verify

mortonSort as default cmake option
VF as default cmake option

makeCylindricalPinMesh for non-square pins

MPACT functions -> Gmsh functions -> field

Back the rays up by -eps

Make the mpact tests work for more types

SIMD versions of routines for mesh.
  point in 4 AABB
  ray intersect 4 lines, etc.

regular grid
  cognitive complex

stdlib -> std::to_string for int, float conversion

Add multidimensional index operator when C++23
  -> Matrix

Add multidimentional array class with elementwise operations
  - Use for partition classes with children

face overlap using connectivity
  - identify boundary edges which are not on the exterior

Use connectivity for ray tracing

SIMD ray/mesh intersection. Can do many at once. Make RayPacket class. Write intersection
routines for edge, polygon, etc.

GPU ray intersect. Need an easy way to get objects on the device. Maybe toDevice() return

SIMD Vector primitives
Use std::simd. Want exp(vector), but only implemented by SVML by intel.
Wait until C++26 or use VCDevel std simd, the implementation that will be in GCC.
Benchmark

Use assume once C++ 23 is supported. See config file

Functions to prevent std::string/std::vector usage in examples and tutorials
  One should bundle functions to hide complexity

Log with multiple arguments to the functions, which automatically call toStgring

Re-add the requirements non-spack installed

Scripts to install gcc

reserve elements/vertices for submesh and read: FVM.toPolytopesoup, spatial_part.toPolytopeSoup

parallelize

VALIDATE RAY TRACING DATA
  intersect which also returns face IDS

Graphics:
  Highlight the intersected cells
    Show ray intersect lattice naive gif. Faces are out of order.
    Show ray intersect lattice morton sorted gif. Better memory access
    Show ray intersect binned lattice. Highlight the box edges and then highlight
      tested faces.
    Show the number of intersected faces each time and the speedup
