Document: 
  Exclusions from clang-tidy
  Clang format choices (var_name, Class, etc.)
  Lack of constexpr -> stdlib is cheating
  
Benchmarks:
  measure effect of SIMD_VEC on vec ops
  measure effect of FASTMATH -> error & speed
  measure Mat<N x N> vs Matrix N x N

Enhancements:
  Small matrix operators
    How to do this in a smart way? Check on Eigen and others.
  Python API
  Rigorous testing of constexpr functions at compile time and runtime

CUDA:
  Add CUDA to unit test macro
  simplify CUDA unit test macros now that we default to 1 thread. TEST_HOSTDEV(f<T>)

Misc:
  OK on lints
  OK on pragma
  Use build scripts to bundle CMAKE options

Naming:
  static_assert to STATIC_ASSERT in tests

constexpr asserts?
check for purity -> noreturn assert

constexpr:
  assert.hpp
  construct at-> placement new

Need to take a hard look at CUDA before proceeding
