ADD TRACE statements to routines

add approximately convex routine for quadrilateral
  -> area
  -> meanchordlength

String -> Check that N is correct for constructors
Replace allocate and copy with macro
deal with HOSTDEV constexpr String(char const * s, Size n) noexcept;

Pick up at +=

std::vector insert


Change valgrind to be optional

old benchmarks to archive

mortonsort for polytope soup
reserve elements/vertices for submesh and read: abaqus, xdmf, FVM.toPolytopesoup, spatial_part.toPolytopeSoup

iterators for edges and faces

ray tests
modular ray tests
cross section tests
material tests

test pointer arithmetic versus index for ray/mesh intersection
test iterating over edges with getEdge vs just manually making them

effect test of morton order on intersect

is_morton_ordered to fvm

binned fvm
