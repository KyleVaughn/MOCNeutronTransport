Make string resemble llvm more

eliminate sto

check nolints, prad

valgrind and cuda test on laptop

variadic template expression for test macros.
Just assume 1 thread 1 block only and that they will write themselves otherwise

allocator

typename to class

log in correct namespace?

variadic template expansion

std::isfinite assumes
Find the conditional jump that depends on uninitialized value in xsec read

Add material convenience functions that openMC has

Function for plotting XSecs
Check that tests are actually using CUDA

No more examples. Make a "models" directory.
  Add options for each parametric study

Method to function

investigate valgrind release build -> UPGRADE to 3.22
-> PURE, ASSUME

eliminate sto in favor of C functions
Typically preceded by a substr, which shouldn't alloc

Add scattering matrix to Xsec
Don't store redundant info? Total
  Optimize to be lower triangular when build without upscatter?

Move the picture of the model to above the code in the tutorial

Resolve casts in gmsh API

Add overlap check to face vertex mesh validate routine

Narrowing uint32_t cast

Modify the Gmsh functions so that they are templated where necessary

Binned mesh
  Need vis before to verify

Back the rays up by -eps

Make the mpact tests work for more types

SIMD versions of routines for mesh.
  point in 4 AABB
  ray intersect 4 lines, etc.

face overlap using connectivity
  - identify boundary edges which are not on the exterior

Use connectivity for ray tracing
  -> Vertex, not edge

SIMD ray/mesh intersection. Can do many at once. Make RayPacket class. Write intersection
routines for edge, polygon, etc.

GPU ray intersect. Need an easy way to get objects on the device. Maybe toDevice() return

SIMD Vector primitives
Use std::simd. Want exp(vector), but only implemented by SVML by intel.
Wait until C++26 or use VCDevel std simd, the implementation that will be in GCC.
Benchmark

Functions to prevent std::string/std::vector usage in examples and tutorials
  One should bundle functions to hide complexity

Re-add the requirements non-spack installed

Scripts to install gcc

reserve elements/vertices for submesh and read: FVM.toPolytopesoup, spatial_part.toPolytopeSoup

parallelize

VALIDATE RAY TRACING DATA
  intersect which also returns face IDS

Graphics:
  Highlight the intersected cells
    Show ray intersect lattice naive gif. Faces are out of order.
    Show ray intersect lattice morton sorted gif. Better memory access
    Show ray intersect binned lattice. Highlight the box edges and then highlight
      tested faces.
    Show the number of intersected faces each time and the speedup

Restore scripts dir

PURE CONST
 -> ASSERTS OK? LOG OK?
Old benchmarks: reimplement or place in archive
clean archive

Point in cell bug for c5g7 mesh

validate intersect

Consistent testing of mesh point inside.
   getOrientedEdge -> return bool, pass edge by ref

Binned FVM

Implement very robust testing of ray vs shape intersections
