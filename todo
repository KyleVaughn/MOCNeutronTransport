add clang-tidy, cuda, and valgrind to unit test macto

create placeholder basics:
  tests
  benchmarks

python API
look at eigen for inspo

add a check on mesh import/export for maximum int size? Or do it in int64

measure effect of SIMD_VEC
measure effect of FAST_MATH -> error

for tests, check against max error and output error into some file

use build scripts to bundle options

simply CUDA unit test macros now that we default to 1 thread

add OK to nolints and pragmas
