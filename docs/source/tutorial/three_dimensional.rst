Three-dimensional Modeling and Meshing
=======================================

This tutorial will demonstrate how to create and mesh 3D CAD geometries of increasing complexity.
It is assumed that the reader has already completed the `2D tutorial <tutorial_2d>`_.
The models we will create are:

  1. `C5G7 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnueene.2004.09.003>`_

  2. `CROCUS <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2005.09.012>`_

C5G7
=======

This is a model of the C5G7 benchmark problem. The goal of this model demonstrate how the concepts and functions
in 2D modeling and meshing extend to 3D.
