The University of Michigan Unstructured Mesh Code (UM\ :sup:`2` \ )
=====================================================

UM\ :sup:`2` \ is a library that aims to enable Method of Characteristics neutron transport
calculations on unstructured polygon meshes and CAD models. The library provides a set of tools 
for automatic Coarse Mesh Finite Difference and Method of Characteristics mesh generation for
CAD models, as well as tools for fast, robust ray tracing, geometric queries, and mesh analysis.

The library can be interfaced with `MPACT <https://vera.ornl.gov/mpact/>`_ 
to perform 2D/1D calculations on unstructured meshes.

UM\ :sup:`2` \ is developed by members of the `Nuclear Reactor Analysis and Methods
Group <https://nuram.engin.umich.edu/>`_ at the `University of Michigan
<https://umich.edu/>`_.
