Measure:
  - Impact of static vs dynamic memory allocation
    - Test run time for static vs dynamic: 
      - Vectors
      - Points
      - Polygons
  - Impact of floating point precision
    - Lower precision vs less memory and less cache misses, etc.
    - Test accuracy, run time, and memory for float with X bits:
      - 16
      - 32
      - 64
  - Impact of SIMD/chunking
    - Is -O3 or -Ofast vectorization sufficient, or is manual SIMD necessary?
    - Test run time for SSE, AVX, etc. for: 
      - Intersection and sweep algorithms, with AVX exponent on the sweep for sure
    - Test run time for chunking for:
      - Intersection algorithm with rays per chunk 
      - Transport sweep algorithm with segments per chunk
  - Impact of runtime polymorphism/compile time constants
    - Test run time for compile time vs run time selection of:
      - Mesh type
      - Ray spacing
      - Number of azi and polar angles per octant
      - Or any other parameter that can be tuned at compile time, especially those in the
        input file
  - Impact of mesh data structure
    - This tests the effects of inderection and cache misses vs extra memory usage
    - Test the following data structures for run time and memory usage:
      - F->E, E->V, V.
      - Explicit F and E, no V. ( Extra 5V storage minimum due to E and F overlap.)
      - F->E, Explicit E, no V. ( Extra 2V storage minimum due to E overlap.)
      - TSFSL ?
  - Impact of spatial partitioning structure and leaf size:
    - Test run time for the following:
